# Wallpaper-Engine-Boilerplate

I wanted to write a wallpaper script for [Wallpaper Engine](https://wallpaperengine.io). I decided to also make this for making it easy to do more.

## Usage

```bash
npx degit devJimmyboy/Wallpaper-Engine-Boilerplate
# or
git clone https://github.com/devJimmyboy/Wallpaper-Engine-Boilerplate.git
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install

yarn install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev

yarn dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build

yarn build
```

## Import into Wallpaper Engine

`Create Wallpaper` -> `Import` -> Select the `dist` folder & finish the import. Make sure to define your user Properties when making it.
